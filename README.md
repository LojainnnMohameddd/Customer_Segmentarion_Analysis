Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project aims to analyze and categorize customers into distinct groups or segments based on their behavior and spending habits. The goal is to better understand the characteristics of each group, which helps businesses target them more effectively with personalized products and marketing campaigns.

Methodology
Data: The project uses the customer personality analysis dataset from Kaggle.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook includes an exploratory analysis to understand the data's distribution and the relationships between different variables.

Modeling: The K-Means Clustering algorithm was applied to group customers into homogeneous segments.

Visualization: Scatter plots were used to visualize the customer segments, showing the relationship between customer age and their spending score.

Results
The analysis successfully identified distinct customer groups, each with different characteristics. For example, it's possible to identify a segment of young customers with high spending scores and another segment of older customers with different behaviors. These insights can inform smarter marketing decisions.
